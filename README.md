## 🧠 Algorithms

### 🔹 Linear Search
- Scans each element from left to right
- Works on unsorted data
- Time Complexity:
  - Best: **O(1)**
  - Worst: **O(n)**
- Space: **O(1)**

### 🔹 Binary Search
- Requires sorted input
- Repeatedly divides the search range
- Time Complexity:
  - Best: **O(1)**
  - Worst: **O(log n)**
- Space: **O(1)** iterative
